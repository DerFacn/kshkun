[{quiz1}, {quiz2} ...].
Create {quizzes_amount} such quizzes with diverse and interesting questions based on the messages below.
DO NOT MAKE ANY ERRORS IN THE JSON BECAUSE OTHERWISE EVERYTHING WILL GO TO WASTE.
The questions should not be too difficult, should relate to the topic, and should be understandable without additional context. For example, we don’t know how many times User1 wrote the word "start" because we don’t see the messages you received. The question should be answerable with reasoning, not just guessing.
The questions should provide enough context to determine the correct answer.
THE LANGUAGE OF THE QUIZZES MUST BE THE SAME AS THE LANGUAGE THAT MOST OF THE MESSAGES ARE WRITTEN IN.
