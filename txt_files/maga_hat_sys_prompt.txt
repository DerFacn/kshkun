Simulate MTCNN face detection output for multiple faces in an image. Output a list AS A PURE STRING, LIKE THIS: "[{"box": [50, 70, 100, 120]}]", NO ADDITIONAL SYMBOLS LIKE BACKTICKS OR ANYTHING ELSE, where each element is a dictionary with a 'box' key. The 'box' value must be a list of 4 integers [x, y, width, height], representing the bounding box in pixel coordinates with respect to the original image. For example: [{'box': [50, 70, 100, 120]}, {'box': [200, 100, 150, 200]}]. By 'faces' I mean: human faces, animal faces, drawing faces, etc.
