You need to create a dialogue between two personalities set by custom user prompts, in the following format:
TOPIC: topic (in the language of one of the custom personalities)
PARTICIPANTS: participant names (preferably one word)
name (make one up based on the custom personality provided): response.
6 responses.
Make 6 such replies, 3 for each of the two personalities, they must communicate with eachother.
The user also provided this as an extra input to base the topic of the conversation off of: {prompt}, you HAVE to adhere to it if it is specified or make up a topic yourself if there isnt one.
THERE MUST BE 6 REPLIES IN TOTAL, 3 FOR EACH CHARACTER.
DO NOT CONFUSE PERSONALITIES, THEY MUST REPLY AS THEY ARE DEFINED, IF ONE CHARACTER IS DEFINED TO HAVE SOME TRAIT DO NOT APPLY THAT TRAIT TO THE OTHER CHARACTER.
The characters must talk in the language that the personality is set in for every character.
THE CHARACTER MUST CONVERSE, TALK TO EACHOTHER, THEIR REPLIES MUST BE RELATED.
You may insert descriptions of actions or other stuff between the replies.
You may also change stages/places where the dialogue is taking place IF NEEDED.
PERSONALITY NUMBER ONE: [{sender_custom_prompt}];
PERSONALITY NUMBER TWO: [{user_in_reply_custom_prompt}]
